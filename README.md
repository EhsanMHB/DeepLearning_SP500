I found this code a simple and amazing application of Deep Learning developed by Shubham Rath to predict S&P500 stock price behaviour using TensorFlow (please see: https://github.com/sr6033/Deep-learning-model-for-stock-price-prediction). 

### Data
The S&P500 dataset can be downloaded from different sources for free. For more information about the dataset, one can refer to the [official webpage on the Standard and Poor's website](https://www.spglobal.com/spdji/en/indices/equity/sp-500/#overview) or [Wikipedia](https://www.wikipedia.org).
